Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the dual selection sort remains O(N^2)
even though it moves two elements into their correct positions
during each pass. The nested loop structure remains,
and the inner loop still iterates over the unsorted portion
of the array for each pass.

Performance Relative to Standard Selection Sort:
The dual selection sort might be slightly faster in practice due to
fewer overall passes through the array (only N/2 outer loop iterations
compared to N in the standard selection sort).
However, the inner loop still iterates over the unsorted part
of the array, so the algorithmic complexity remains quadratic.

Performance Relative to Merge Sort:
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(NlogN), which is
significantly better than O(N^2).
Thus, Merge Sort is expected to be much faster than the dual
selection sort for large arrays. The dual selection sort,
despite its optimization over standard selection sort,
still performs poorly compared to algorithms with better
time complexity like Merge Sort.
